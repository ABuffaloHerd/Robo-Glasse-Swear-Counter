# Robo Glasse Swear Counter

- Counts slurs! (separate count for hard-rs)
- Counts custom words! ('slayy', 'giving', 'yass queen ðŸ‘‘')
- Counts per user statistics! (per server)
- Leaderboards! Now you can see who said "slayyy ðŸ’…" the most and **shoot them dead.**
- Tips! "As a Medic, your default Syringe Gun automatically heals you over time by 3 health per second compared to the Blutsauger's 1 health per second. Use the Syringe Gun when playing defensively, as the passive healing rate will provide you with an advantage."
